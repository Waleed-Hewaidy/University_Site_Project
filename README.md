# University_Site_Project
##hypothetical site of a university (or college), contains details of what university offers ;such as departments, statistics, payments and other details.

It's a simple comeback project using vanilla Javascript, the point of this project is wtha I wanted to refresh my info after a 9 months-break (away from 
coding).

All the data used in this project is hard coded, no API or HTTP requests were made (Will be used in upcoming projects).

Eventually, I hope any that comes by this project and see my repo will find it useful and helpful.

Thank you .
